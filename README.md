# Multimodal LLMs for Reasoning Based Detection of Anomalies
This repository contains the AI Operator, an automated framework developed as the core outcome of the thesis titled ‚ÄúMultimodal LLMs for Reasoning-Based Detection of Anomalies"

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

```python
python main.py
```
```install requirements
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ† Setting Up

By default the project uses Google Vertex AI which requires a Google Cloud account and a project with billing enabled. Two ways to authenticate are available: using application default credentials (ADC) or an API key. For creating an API key, ADC is required anyway. To set up the ADC, follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc).

Here's how to authenticate on macOS:

```sh
brew install google-cloud-sdk  # Follow the instructions to log in
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
```
Here's how to authenticate on Windows:

```sh
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")
& $env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Next set up the environment variables in a `.env` file:

```sh
VERTEXAI_PROJECT="example-project"
VERTEXAI_LOCATION="europe-central2

EMAIL_USERNAME="email@address.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="email_password"
```

Other option is to use ChatGPT. In this case a personal project and API key must be created in order to authenticate requests and interact with the model programmatically through OpenAI's API.
THe API Key must be defined in `.env` file.

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY = "openAI_apikey"
```
